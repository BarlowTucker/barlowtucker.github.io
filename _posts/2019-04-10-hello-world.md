Hello World

Welcome! This is a place for me to put down some of my thoughts on everything from Software Development to Parenting to Reglion to Leadership.

About Me
I having been writing software since 2003, starting with web then moving to writing apps for iOS. I currently run The Tucker Brothers and lead the mobile development teams at Jane. (The views I post on this site are my own and do not reflect the view of my employers).

When I am not writing code, I am spending time with my family. I have the most amazing wife and children in the world and I love being with them.

I am also a member of the LDS church, which most people know as the Mormon church. I am always happy to answer questions about the what’s and why’s of what I believe. A great place to start would be https://www.lds.org.
