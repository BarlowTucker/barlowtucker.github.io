# Hello World

Welcome! This is a place for me to put down some of my thoughts on everything from Software Development to Parenting to Reglion to Leadership.  

## About Me
I having been writing software since 2003, starting with web then moving to writing apps for iOS.  I currently run [The Tucker Brothers](www.thetuckerbros.com) and lead the mobile development teams at [Jane](jane.com). (The views I post on this site are my own and do not reflect the view of my employers).  

When I am not writing code, I am spending time with my family.  I have the most amazing wife and children in the world and I love being with them.

I am also a member of the LDS church, which most people know as the Mormon church.  I am always happy to answer questions about the what's and why's of what I believe. A great place to start would be [https://www.lds.org](https://www.lds.org).
