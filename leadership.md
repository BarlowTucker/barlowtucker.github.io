## What is Leadership?
Leadership is the art of aligning individual interests with group interests. A great leader inspires growth, shares the group's vision, gives all voices a safe space, and multiplies outcomes.

My own leadership philosophy has been built over years of practice, study, mistakes and successes. Leaders do not need to be experts in all things. Instead, a leader makes sure the right experts are brought together and each voice is heard.

Below are quick overviews of the main characteristics of leadership, along with some thoughts and research on the topic. There is a lot more to say than I will put on this page, however, if you'd like more information, each section links to blog posts, training courses and books on the topic.

## Expectations
Leaders are responsible for executing on a vision. They gather the right people together and explain expected outcomes. People being lead must be set up for success by the leaders on their team.

Research shows setting clear expectations improves outcomes. ==TODO==

Setting clear expectations with measurable outcomes with teams and individuals creates an environment where both can be set up for success. This has the added benefit that no one is left wondering how well their performance measures up. 

Clear expectations are
- recorded somewhere accessible
- reviewed with the employee
- measurable with an agreed target
- followed up on regularly

#### Unclear Expectation
We want you to build a new team.

#### Clear and Measurable Expectation: 
You are expected to build your team. This is measured by:

- The percentage of your quarterly hiring goal of X achieved
- Your team's attrition rate for the quarter (goal of X)
- Staying at or under the payroll budget of X for your department

## Communication
Communication is one of the critical skills any leader needs to have. Great communication can be broken down into the following elements:
- Listening and Understanding
- Creating a Safe Space for Dialogue
- Setting and Resetting Expectations
- Expressing Genuine Empathy
- Clearly Expressing Ideas

Great communication starts with the ability to listen to and understand others. In his book [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://amzn.to/3Y9BpdA), Steven Covey shares the following: ==TODO==

An often overlooked aspect of a leader's role in communication is the creation of safe spaces. ==TODO: Crucial Conversations==

It is also crucial that leaders are able to clearly express themselves. Communication from a leader should be clear, genuine and honest. Leaders should only say they will do things they believe they will do. In the cases where they are unable to meet a commitment, they should reset expectations quickly. Communication should also be candid, transparent and empathetic. The book [Radical Candor](https://amzn.to/3Yfotmj) does a great job expressing this concept. Kim Scott expresses this concept on two axis: candor and empathy.

## Lifting Up
Helping the people on your teams level up their skills plays an important role in individual motivation and team execution. A study from Gallup research found that most millennials want coaching, development and greater purpose from their jobs[^1].
