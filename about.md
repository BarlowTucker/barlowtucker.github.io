Welcome to my blog! This is a space for me to share some thoughts on entrepreneurship, start-ups, technology and leadership. 

I first started writing code back in 1998 when I created a simple ascii art game. I found a love for writing software to build useful tools and games. After college, I started my first business creating websites and web applications for local businesses. Since then I have started four companies (Avante Web Design, The Tucker Brothers, Stage 3 and Wholesome Software) and helped 3 start-ups (AdvancedMD, Jane and Route).

I am passionate about building engineering teams with a strong culture of trust and respect. When trust and respect are central to a team's culture, teams build each other up, skills are deepened, and business objectives can be aligned to individual interest and skill.

When I'm not playing with new technology, writing code, or building teams, I love to spend his time running, hanging out with his family, and enjoying the outdoors.
