Barlow Tucker is an Entrepreneur, Engineering Leader and Software Engineer. He built his first computer game in 1998 and fell in love with writing code and all things tech. Since then, he has started 3 companies, and has worked with multiple start-ups. He specializes in building top tier engineering teams and scaling small businesses into global companies.

When he isn't playing with new technology, writing code, or building teams, Barlow loves to spend his time running, hanging out with his family, and enjoying the outdoors.
